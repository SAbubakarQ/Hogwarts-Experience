## Hogwarts-Experience

### The Hogwarts Experience

This .cpp file contains the contents for the Hogwart's Experience, a project created in Progrmaing Foundations I. It includes the wand building simulator and the housing sortment. Simply copy and paste the contents inside the main.cpp file and paste it into any C++ compiler.

Update March 14th, 2023 - I've came a long way from understanding simple C++ code. From copy and pasting, simply clone the reposity to your local drive and you should be able to interact with the system.
